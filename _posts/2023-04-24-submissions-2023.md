###### Oral presentations

Presentations about results of research projects, developments or initiatives that, due to their originality or potential application and impact on the use or development of R in academia or industry, are of interest to the regional R community. Those who participate in this modality will have 20 minutes for the presentation and 5 minutes for Q&A.
<br>
###### Lightning Talks

Lightning talks provide an opportunity to present and discuss advances, ideas, ongoing research, experiences and challenges related to LatinR's topics. Those who participate in this modality will have 5 minutes for the presentation. Lightning talks will be grouped into thematic sessions that will include a final round of Q&A.

###### Posters

Like Lightning Talks, the posters provide an opportunity to present progress and ongoing projects related to LatinR's topics. During the conference there will be a time block for the presentation of posters and dialogue with the audience.
<br><br>

##### Submitting a proposal

- All the proposals will have to be submitted as a PDF, **without authors' names nor their affiliations**, letter sized document, typed using a font size 11 and single line spacing. Maximum 2 pages.

- There is a package developed by Elio Campitelli that allows you to create the abstract as an R Markdown file. You can see the details [here](https://latin-r.com/blog/latinr-package). In previous editions, it was possible to send the abstracts directly from RStudio; however, due to changes with the previous platform (EasyChair), we will be using a new one (Open Review) and the automated submission won't be available.

If you prefer using a different text editor, we kindly ask you to use [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KrPbi2AR5Rcq5fKMkC_yK_9gpez4Fmtz/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107644076848762167027&rtpof=true&sd=true).

- The submissions will be accepted via the [Open Review](https://openreview.net/group?id=LATIN-R.com/2023/Conference) platform. You will have to register before hand. Please, do this as soon as you can, as the account activation on Open Review can take up to 24 hours.

- For those sending proposals authored by more than one person, only one of them has to sign up on Open Review.

- You can only submit one proposal as the main author, but you are welcome to contribute as the co-author of two other submissions.

- All the submissions will be carefully reviewed by the Scientific Committee (soon to be announced), considering their originallity, contributions, quality and clarity.
